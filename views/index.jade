        #[strong My name is Brandon Gonzalez.]
        I'm a freshman at Drexel University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
        My main area of interest is distributed systems, specifically
        consensus/consistency stuff, architecture, and databases.

        | I spent a good chunk of my time in highschool doing robotics. Read a
        | lot of C and Java, wrote a lot of C and Java. Became head of programming
        | and controls my junior year and ended up winning the FRC world
        | championship that year. However the long hours on top of school work
        | burned me out, so I decided to leave the team at the end of my junior year.

        | I ended up interning an older hardware company called Larson Automation
        | during my 2014 summer. We built in circuit testing fixtures, which are
        | used to automatically test circuit boards. I worked on embedded C to
        | run those fixtures, wrote a bit of firmware, and rewrote an old C++
        | test log analysis tool in Clojure.
